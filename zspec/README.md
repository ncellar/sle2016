## Z Specification companion to paper "Taming Context-Sensitive Languages with Principled Stateful Parsing"

The specification is contained within the file `spec.zed8`.
This file can be understood by the [Community Z Tools IDE][czt]. You'll need the 1.6.0 version,
as the 2.0 version wasn't working properly at the time of writing.

After opening CZT, simply import this directory as an existing project, and you'll be able to
manipulate the specification. The IDE will report any syntactic or typing mistake.
