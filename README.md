# Taming Context-Sensitive Languages with Principled Stateful Parsing

Nicolas Laurent & Kim Mens

Our submission comprises two artifacts:

- The code for the Autumn parsing library (`autumn`)
- The Z specification presented in the paper (`zspec`)

Further instructions and details can be found in the `README.md` file of each directory.

In the `autumn` directory, the use-case grammar described in the paper can be
run over an example by running `make examply`.

The online home of Autumn (for future versions) is [github.com/norswap/autumn][u2d]
